     everything again — two separate jumps stacked on top of each
     other. The first jump is the browser's own scroll-restoration
     feature (it remembers where a document was scrolled and tries to
     put it back there on reload) fighting the fact that a fresh
     native-GHL post has no real content yet at that instant, so
     "where it was scrolled" doesn't correspond to anything real. Set
     as early as possible (module scope, not inside whenReady) and
     unconditionally on every load: doesn't require the DOM, doesn't
     re-run on internal SPA-style navigation (a new document load
     re-executes this whole script from scratch), and every browser
     that lacks the API just skips the guarded call. */

     targets fresh on every call rather than caching one reference at
     script-load time. Two reasons this has to stay a live query
     instead of a cached `var`:
     1. On a GHL post, `.dgs-ga-body` never exists — `#blogPostContent`
        (a fixed GHL id, not a per-widget random hash, so this is
        safe/stable) is the equivalent "just the written content, not
        hero/TOC/related/CTA" element there.
     2. GHL's Vue hydration can replace .blog-html-container-single
        (and everything inside it, #blogPostContent included) wholesale
        — documented in insertDek() below. A cached reference to the
        old node would go stale/detached, and a detached element's

     just by pillar but by POST, not a single fixed name: Learn posts
     (regular articles) use `.dgs-blog-render`, Connect posts (events)
     use `.dgs-event-template-page` — and within Implement, EVERY post
     so far has used its own class: a checklist post uses

  /* ─── Smooth-scroll helper, routed through Lenis when it's active ───
     js/main.js initializes Lenis sitewide with `autoRaf: true` and
     exposes the instance as `window.dgsLenis`. Confirmed live (the
     actual bug behind Back to Top and TOC links landing on the wrong
     heading — not a wrong offset calculation): autoRaf means Lenis runs
     its own continuous requestAnimationFrame loop that keeps driving the
     native scroll position from Lenis's OWN internal virtual scroll
     state. Calling `window.scrollTo()` directly doesn't inform that
     state — it fights it instead, so the page starts moving toward the
     right target and then gets pulled back toward wherever Lenis's
     untouched internal position still says it should be, one frame
     later. Every programmatic scroll in this file has to go through
     Lenis's own `scrollTo(target, { offset })` API instead once Lenis
     exists, which updates that internal state directly so there's
     nothing left to fight. `target` is a number (absolute scroll Y) or
     an element; `offsetPx` (positive = clearance) shifts the landing
     point up by that many px, e.g. to clear the fixed navbar — Lenis's
     own `offset` option is ADDED to the target position, so this negates
     it to match. Falls back to native `window.scrollTo` only when Lenis
     truly isn't on the page (e.g. prefers-reduced-motion, which
     js/main.js's initSmoothScroll() never initializes Lenis for at
     all). */

     its own internal scroll state that a raw window.scrollTo() would

     GHL's own widget renders `.hl-blog-content-back-to-top-container
     > button.back-to-top` — a bare <button> with no href/onclick; its
     scroll behavior depends entirely on GHL's own Vue click binding,
     which is attached DIRECTLY to that button element (standard Vue
     `@click="handler"` compiles to `element.addEventListener('click',
     handler)` on the actual rendered node — not a document-level
     delegate), so GHL's handler always runs for a click on that node
     regardless of what else is listening elsewhere.

     A capture-phase `document` listener (tried first) should in theory
     still run before that — capturing always finishes before a
     listener on the target itself fires, per spec, regardless of
     registration order — but user testing after that version still
     showed the OLD symptom (lands on whatever heading is nearest the
     current scroll position, not the first one), meaning GHL's handler
     was still the one actually driving the scroll. Rather than keep
     guessing at event-phase timing, this instead REMOVES GHL's handler
     outright: cloning the button (`cloneNode`) copies its markup but
     not any JS listeners attached to the original node, so the clone
     is a clean element with zero click behavior of its own.
     Swapping it in and attaching only our own listener means there is
     no longer a second handler to race against — deterministic
     regardless of registration order or how many listeners GHL had
     attached. `data-ga-fixed` guards this idempotent (skips an
     already-cloned button) the same way every other GHL-sync function
     here guards against the shared MutationObserver re-running it, and
     lets this correctly re-fix a wholesale replacement button if GHL's
     Vue hydration ever swaps the subtree back in (same documented
     behavior as insertDek() above).

     Destination is the article's FIRST heading, not window top (user
     feedback: this button lives at the bottom of the article, and the
     desired behavior is "back to the top of the article", not all the
     way past the hero) — same element buildToc() below reads, so this
     always agrees with whatever the on-page nav's first entry points
     to. Falls back to window top only if the post has no headings at

  /* ─── GHL: hero description from the post's own meta description ───
     .dgs-ga-hero shows a dek/description paragraph under the date;
     GHL's native Blog Content widget doesn't render one. Reuses the
     post's own <meta name="description"> — the same text the static
     template's own dek is hand-typed from (verified identical on
     founder-dependency-test.html), so this is real per-post data, not
     invented copy. Guarded the same way as the TOC below: only on a
     GHL post, only once.

     GHL's blog widget is a Nuxt/Vue component that server-renders the
     post markup, then hydrates client-side. Because insertDek() adds a
     real DOM node inside .blog-html-container-single BEFORE that
     hydration pass runs, Vue's hydration walk finds a child-list
     mismatch it can't reconcile in place, and Vue 3's documented
     recovery is to discard and fully REPLACE that DOM subtree with
     freshly client-rendered nodes rather than patch it — this can
     replace .blog-html-container-single itself, not just its children
     (confirmed live: the dek would flash in, then vanish for good once
     the page finished rendering — a one-time event, not a flicker).
     A MutationObserver watching only .blog-html-container-single's own
     childList is blind to that: if the container node itself gets
     swapped out, the observer keeps watching the old, now-detached
     node and never fires again. So instead this observes document.body
     (guaranteed to survive any such replacement) with subtree:true,
     and insertDek() re-queries the live DOM fresh every time — it's
     idempotent (no-ops once the dek already exists), so it just keeps
     re-asserting the dek for the life of the page no matter how many
     times GHL rebuilds the subtree underneath it. */

     `<a class="blog-back-button"><i class="blog-left-arrow"></i>

     child of the <a> (a childNodes-only scan tried that previously and
     silently matched nothing, since <i> and <span> are both element
     nodes), it's one level deeper inside the <span>. A TreeWalker
     visits every descendant text node regardless of nesting, so this

     rewrites nodes that still say "Back to Blog" so re-runs are
     no-ops. Reuses insertDek's own MutationObserver/re-query strategy

  /* ─── TOC link clicks: smooth-scroll accounting for the fixed navbar ───

     since this site runs Lenis sitewide) would land a heading flush
     against the viewport top, underneath the fixed .dgs-header, UNLESS
     the target has `scroll-margin-top` set. The static template's own
     headings get that via `.dgs-ga-body h2/h3` in dgs-growth-article.css
     — but a GHL post's `.dgs-blog-render` headings are styled by a
     <style> block pasted per-post directly in GHL's editor (confirmed
     on the live page), outside this repo, with no such offset. Rather
     than depend on every post's own pasted CSS getting this right,
     this computes the offset in JS, reusing the same TOC_SCROLL_OFFSET
     the Back to Top fix above declares. Capture phase + stopPropagation
     stops Lenis's own `anchors: true` handling from also acting on the
     same click and scrolling to the raw (un-offset) position; routing
     the actual scroll through scrollToTarget() (Lenis-aware, see above)
     stops Lenis's autoRaf loop from fighting a raw window.scrollTo() and
     pulling the page back toward the wrong position afterward — the

/* ============================================================
   PREVIOUS / NEXT ARTICLE (.dgs-blog-prev-next)
   Own top-level IIFE — separate concern from the share component
   above. Markup lives inside "More Perspectives" (see ghl-blog.html),
   static and always present, so (same reasoning as the share
   component) this needs no MutationObserver/whenReady gating beyond
   DOMContentLoaded and never depends on the native GHL widget on
   THIS page finishing anything, because it doesn't read anything
   from this page's own widget at all — see below.

   ─── WHY THIS FETCHES /growth-hub INSTEAD OF READING LOCAL DATA ───
   Inspected first, per the brief, rather than assumed: an individual
   GHL blog post page (the .dgs-ghl-native-blog-slot content documented
   at the top of this file) exposes NO previous/next post data of any
   kind — no {{post.previous}}-style variable, no native prev/next
   widget, nothing. Confirmed by the same live-DOM investigations
   already on record in this codebase (css/dgs-growth-hub.css "GROWTH
   HUB FIX 3-6" comments, this file's own getGhlRender()/insertDek()
   comments): the ONLY documented place the actual ordered list of
   Growth Hub posts exists is GHL's native "Blog Posts" widget
   (.hl-blog-post-home), which is dropped directly into the Growth Hub
   LISTING page (/growth-hub) in GHL's page builder — never into the
   individual post template. There is no post-count, ordering, or
   listing API exposed anywhere else in this project to fall back on.

   So: fetch /growth-hub (a real, same-origin page, not invented),
   parse its rendered HTML, and search every .hl-blog-post-home
   instance found there for a card whose real href matches the
   CURRENT page's own URL. Once found, "previous"/"next" are simply
   that card's immediate siblings inside the SAME widget instance —
   this deliberately never has to know in advance which pillar
   (Learn/Implement/Inspire) the current post belongs to, so it can't
   get that wrong: whichever widget the current post's own card
   actually turns up in IS the right list to walk. The order those
   cards render in is GHL's own (confirmed live: newest-first), not
   anything invented here.

   ─── ONE CONFIRMED LIMITATION (surfaced, not hidden) ───
   That native widget paginates its results SERVER-SIDE — confirmed by
   this exact codebase's own pagination handling elsewhere (see
   wireRestore()/wirePaginationScrollAnchor() above, and the matching
   .pagination-button logic in js/dgs-careers.js): clicking a page
   number replaces the widget's DOM via an async request, meaning only
   ONE page's worth of cards exists in the HTML at any given time.
   A plain fetch() of /growth-hub therefore only ever sees each
   pillar's FIRST page. For a post recent enough to still be on page 1
   of its pillar, previous/next resolve correctly. For an older post
   that has scrolled onto page 2+, this can't find it and the whole
   component fails gracefully (stays hidden) rather than guessing —
   there is no documented API in this project for fetching a specific
   page of that widget from outside a live GHL session, so this is the
   safest correct behavior available rather than a bug: no navigation
   is shown, never a broken one.

   Real card selectors below (.hl-blog-post-home, .blog-post-wrapper-list,
   h2.blog-title) — RE-CONFIRMED 2026-09-21 against an actual saved
   capture of the live /growth-hub page (the user's own browser "Save
   As", not this repo's static files): all three pillar widgets on
   that page currently render their cards as .blog-post-wrapper-list
   (the "Grid"/three-col layout), not .blog-post-wrapper-compact.
   That capture also caught this component sitting on a real live post
   with [hidden] never cleared — root cause was exactly this selector
   mismatch (querySelectorAll found zero cards, so applyResult() never
   ran). .blog-post-wrapper-compact is kept alongside it purely as a
   defensive fallback (that's the shape documented for the Careers
   listing widget elsewhere in this codebase; GHL could render Growth
   Hub the same way on a future layout change) — it is NOT what's live
   today. GHL's Grid layout is also documented (js/dgs-careers.js
   flattenGridCards()) to sometimes nest card N+1 INSIDE card N instead
   of as a proper sibling; querySelectorAll finds every match regardless
   of nesting depth, in true document order, so previous/next stay
   correct either way — confirmed against the real capture's card
   order (6 titles in Learn, extracted via a plain sequential scan,
   matched GHL's own rendered order exactly). */
